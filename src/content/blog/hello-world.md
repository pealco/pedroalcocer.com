This is the first post on my new blog. I built it with [Astro](https://astro.build), a modern static site generator that ships zero JavaScript by default.

## Why Astro?

Astro is great for content-focused websites. It lets you write in Markdown, use components from any framework, and generates fast static pages.

## What's next

I'll be writing about things I find interesting — programming, linguistics, and whatever else comes to mind.

Stay tuned.
